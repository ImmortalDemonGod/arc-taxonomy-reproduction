# Section 7.1 Compositional Gap - Updated Statistics

## Summary Statistics

Completed LoRA training runs: 302
Failed runs: 44
Total tasks parsed: 302

## Compositional Gap Definition

Tasks meeting BOTH criteria:
- final_cell_accuracy > 80.0%
- final_grid_accuracy < 10.0%

## Core Finding

Compositional Gap Count: 210 of 302 tasks (69.5%)

This represents tasks where the model achieves high local pattern recognition (>80% cell accuracy)
but fails to compose those patterns into global solutions (<10% grid accuracy).

## Top 10 Extreme Examples (>90% cell, 0% grid)

1. dc433765: 99.64% cell / 0.00% grid
2. 63613498: 99.36% cell / 0.00% grid
3. 98cf29f8: 98.85% cell / 0.00% grid
4. 54d82841: 98.84% cell / 0.00% grid
5. e9614598: 98.78% cell / 0.00% grid
6. d89b689b: 98.70% cell / 0.00% grid
7. d6ad076f: 98.62% cell / 0.00% grid
8. 508bd3b6: 98.26% cell / 0.00% grid
9. beb8660c: 98.25% cell / 0.00% grid
10. 952a094c: 98.23% cell / 0.00% grid

## Historical Context

Previous measurements:
- Original claim in draft: 127 of 186 (68%)
- Verified in older JSON: 129 of 190 (67.9%)
- Current (latest sync): 210 of 302 (69.5%)

The consistency across dataset sizes (67.9% → 69.5%) validates that the Compositional Gap
is a robust, reproducible phenomenon, not an artifact of sample size or specific task selection.

## Reproducibility

To regenerate these statistics:
```bash
python3 - << 'PY'
import json
p="reproduction/outputs/atomic_lora_training_summary.json"
with open(p) as f: data=json.load(f)
records=[(tid, m.get("final_cell_accuracy",0.0), m.get("final_grid_accuracy",0.0))
         for tid, rec in data.get("tasks",{}).items()
         if (m := rec.get("metadata",{}))]
cg=[r for r in records if r[1] > 80.0 and r[2] < 10.0]
print(f"Compositional Gap: {len(cg)} of {len(records)} ({len(cg)/len(records)*100:.1f}%)")
PY
